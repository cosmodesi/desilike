Introduction
############

Contributions to **desilike** are very welcome! Currently, contributions are overseen by Arnaud de Mattia, Johannes U. Lange, and Kushal Lodha. Please reach out to them if you have any questions about contributing.

All `desilike` development happens on GitHub. Follow these steps to contribute to `desilike`.

1. Create a GitHub account and request access to the `cosmodesi <https://github.com/cosmodesi>`_ GitHub group.
2. Create a separate branch for your changes.
3. Make your code changes, ensuring you:
   
   - Follow the `PEP8 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/>`_ code style standard, within reason.
   - Include complete and accurate docstrings for any new or modified code (see :ref:`developer-documentation`).
   - Add unit tests for new functionality, as required (see :ref:`developer-tests`).

4. Once you are satisfied with your changes, create a pull request. A main developer will review your contribution, provide feedback, and merge it if everything passes.
